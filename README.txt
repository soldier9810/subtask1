My name is Aryan Gupta from EEE branch (Roll number: 220108011). I am from Lucknow. I really like programming and working with electronics.

Open source will be useful for me since contributing to it will improve my coding skills as well as help others. Helping others is important too since there might be times where I might require some help from open source and giving it back is important too.
